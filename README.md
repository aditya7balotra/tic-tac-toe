# tic-tac-toe

<br>
everybody might have ever played this game and me as a beginner has a good project of making this type of game.
<br>
So for those who dont know that what actually happens, this can be very useful-
<br>
this game requires two players and they have to mark 'X' or 'O' respectively on the gameboard , the one player who becomes successful to make a strait line going through the whole board with the alloted mark('X' or 'O') with his/her strategy or anything wins the game
